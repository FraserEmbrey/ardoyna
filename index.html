                <p>
                    The Ardoyna Project is a unique charity dedicated to bringing joy and tranquility to children with autism. 
                    Using a beautifully restored old wooden boat, we take small groups of children onto the ocean, allowing 
                    them to experience the calming and therapeutic effects of blue spaces. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The boat, named *Ardoyna*, is more than a vessel—it's a safe haven where children can connect with 
                    nature, explore their senses, and find peace.
                </p>

                <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                <p>
                    We believe every child deserves a moment of calm, an opportunity to feel the wind in their hair, 
                    and the soothing rhythm of ocean waves. Our mission is to use the therapeutic power of blue spaces 
                    to improve the mental health and well-being of children with autism, offering them experiences 
                    that foster joy, connection, and growth.
                </p>
